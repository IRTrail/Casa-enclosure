# Casa the Milo enclosure

**DISCLAIMER** this is a WORK IN PROGRESS, building it right now probably won't go smoothly, we're actively working on it, somethings might be wrong or even missing completely.

That being said

Welcome to the Casa repository this is an enclosure for our milling machine, the [Milo](https://github.com/MilleniumMills/Millenium-Milo-v1.5)

## Features

- Keeps the mess contained
- Reduces the sound profile of the machine
- Easily accessible electronics bay

- (optional) tablet mount

(and probably a lot of other cool stuff)

## Getting started

We'd recommend going through the [documentation](docs/README.md), this will help get a grasp on the parts and work needed to get the enclosure up.
