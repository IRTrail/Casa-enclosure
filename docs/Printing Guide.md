# Printing Guide

The [STL Files](../STL%20Files/) follow a naming convention where:

- `[a]` means this part is expected to be printed in the accent color of your build
- `(optional)` means it's optional
- `x` followed by a number tells you how many of this part you need for the build

Parts come in the right orientation for printing, just drop them in your slicer with the right profile and you should be good to go.

Supports should be disabled and everything should print fine, purpose designed supports are **included** in some of the models.
